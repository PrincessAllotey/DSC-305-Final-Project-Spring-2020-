# DSC305FinalProject
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 30th January 2020. As at early May, the virus has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide including African countries which form the focus of this project.

In this project, I analysed COVID-19 data from African countries including data on confirmed cases (both daily and total), symptoms, deaths, government measures and school closures.

The BIG IDEA questions are:

1. Can we predict the likelihood of occurrence and the rate of occurrence of a COVID case, in a country, in the near future?
2. What are the patterns in how the variables in the datasets relate over time?
3. What is the trend in COVID cases over the days under study?
4. Can we predict the likelihood of occurrence of a COVID case considering age structure of the countries under study or even other indicators of other non-African countries?
